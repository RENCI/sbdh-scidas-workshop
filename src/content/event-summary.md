## Description

The Workshop on Scientific Data Analysis at Scale (SciDAS) Cloud Computing Workshop intends to facilitate a discussion among researchers, developers, funders, and research computing professional communities on:

- Perspectives on Cloud Computing
- Workflow Development in Democratized Clouds for Porting to Commercial Clouds
- Applied Kubernetes for Genomics
- Managing Cloud costs
- Campus Change Management for Cloud Activities
- FAIR principles
- Data Security
- Data Lifecycle in the cloud 

This will be a hands on workshop with discussion addressing questions such as:
- How are costs calculated and monitored?
- Where are workflows documented and maintained?

The workshop will include demos of virtual machine (VM) labs using an artificial intelligence platform that will be available asynchronously to participants during and after the workshop.

Participants are encouraged to attend with campus partners representing a variety of stakeholders for campus research computing (e.g., PIs, research computing professionals, etc.)   Participant funding is available.

This workshop is funded by the NSF, hosted RENCI and organized by Alex Feltus, Shannon McKeen, Amanda Miller and the South Big Data Hub.

## Background

More and more research is being done by teams of people spread across multiple organizations. In addition these teams are working with larger quantities of data that need to be shared and maintained. Advances in cloud computing has created advantages to working with data in a cloud environment as opposed to data stored on site and copied or accessed remotely. 

 The use of data storage and compute in the cloud provides advantages to large, multi-institutional projects but is not easy to initiate.  The effective management and movement of data to and in the cloud involves a number of considerations including cost, change management, security, daa management and the data life cycle.
